The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Ingo Email
Filter Rules Manager version H3 (1.2.4).

Ingo is an email-filter management application. It is fully internationalized,
integrated with Horde and the IMP Webmail client, and supports both
server-side (Sieve, procmail) and client-side (IMAP) rule creation.

Major changes compared to the Ingo H3 (1.2.3) version are:
    * Improved support for Dovecot.
    * Added support for composite header rules with IMAP backends.
    * Other bug fixes and improvements.
